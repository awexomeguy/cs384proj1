The assignment is split into 2 parts:
	First, to implement Ricart and Agrawala's algorithm in the problem described in the assignment
	Second, to modify the algorithm to allow multiple people to cross the bridge if they are moving in the same direction
	
The solution to the first part can be found in the directory 'demo1'
To compile, go into the directory 'demo1' and use the command

	javac *.java
	
Then to run the program, use the command

	java MainDemo
	
Use the sliders at the top of the window to control the movement speed of the people (represented by colored circles)

The solution to the second part can be found in the directory 'demo2'
To compile, go into the directory 'demo2' and use the command

	javac *.java
	
Then to run the program, use the command

	java MainDemo2
	
Use the sliders at the top of the window to control the movement speed of the people (represented by colored circles)
